Install pyinstaller using 
 pip install pyinstaller

if you don't want console and want a single file then use the below command.
      pyinstaller Main.py --noconsole --onefile
You can now delete the build folder and also the Main.SPEC file
copy the Main.exe from dist folder and paste where your images and config file is there.


if you want console then remove the --noconsole 
pyinstaller Main.py --onefile
